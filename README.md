> A Front-end Web Developer from Brazil that loves technology in general.

Curious on how websites are coded and work since the "Blogger" era (2010ish). Because of that curiosity I used to mod sites and games as a hobby while being just a kid at the time, then I had my first contact with programming logic with C++ back in ~2013 moding and solving a game problem. And guess what? ! Loved it!

I'm also a gaming tech enthusiast, so I love watching [DigitalFoundry](https://www.youtube.com/user/digitalfoundry)!
