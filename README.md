> A Front-end Web Developer from Brazil that loves technology in general.

Curious on how websites are coded and work since the "Blogger" era (2010ish). Because of that curiosity I mod games as a hobby since I first modded a mod called "Deathrun" for Call Of Duty 4, wich was the first time ever I had contact with programming logic with C++ back in ~2013. And guess what?! Loved it!

I'm also a gamer and a gaming/engine/hardware/tech in general enthusiast, I love watching [DigitalFoundry](https://www.youtube.com/user/digitalfoundry)!
