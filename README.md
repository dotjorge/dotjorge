I'm <b>Jorge</b> - a Web Developer and Software Analysis and Development student from Brazil that loves technology in general.
\
Most familiar with the Front-end, coming from PHP on WordPress with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) for both front and back-end to using now Next.js as the front and WP REST API for the back-end, at the moment. Working on a personal project with these characteristics.
<b>A little more about me:</b>
\
Blogger and curious about how websites are coded and work since the "Blogger" era, on aproximately 2010. And I also like to mod games since I first modded a mod called "Deathrun" for Call Of Duty 4, wich was the first time ever I had contact with programming logic with C++ back in 2013 and loved it!
\
\
I'm a gamer and a gaming/engine/hardware technology enthusiast too, I love watching DigitalFoundry.

<b>Learning at the moment:</b>
- React and Next.js
